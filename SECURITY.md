# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security issues **privately** via either of:

1. **GitHub Private Security Advisories** —
   <https://github.com/NaanyaBiz/haggle/security/advisories/new>
   (preferred — keeps the reporter and the maintainer in a single thread).
2. **Email** — `security@naanya.biz`.

Please do **not** open a public issue for security reports.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **5 business days** and to publish a
fix or mitigation note in `CHANGELOG.md` within **30 days** of confirmation.
This is a single-maintainer hobby project; severe issues will be escalated,
but please calibrate expectations accordingly.

## Supported Versions

The latest tagged release on `main` is the only supported version. Beta
tags (`vX.Y.Z-beta.N`) receive fixes; older `v0.0.x-dev` tags do not. There
is no LTS branch.

## Scope

In scope:
- The Python code under `custom_components/haggle/` and `tests/`.
- The CI workflows under `.github/workflows/`.
- The documented HACS install path.

Out of scope:
- Issues in upstream Home Assistant or upstream `aiohttp`/`cryptography`
  (please report to those projects directly).
- Issues in AGL Energy's API itself — we are a client of an undocumented
  endpoint and have no privileged relationship with AGL.
- Vulnerabilities that require already-compromised local code execution
  on the HA host (the integration's threat model assumes the HA process
  is trusted).

## Threat Model Summary

The full threat model lives in `security/2026-05-02T04-43Z/stride/`. The
short version:

### Trust boundaries

| Boundary | Notes |
|---|---|
| AGL HTTPS API → HA coordinator | TLS + Trust-On-First-Use SPKI pinning (see below). |
| HA user browser → config flow | OAuth state nonce + PKCE S256. |
| AGL JSON → HA recorder/statistics | Allowlist-style parsing; numeric values clamped to non-negative finite floats. |
| GitHub Actions → HACS installers | All Actions SHA-pinned; release artefacts attested via `actions/attest-build-provenance`. |

### Trust-On-First-Use TLS pinning

The integration captures the SHA-256 SPKI hash of `secure.agl.com.au`
and `api.platform.agl.com.au` during the initial PKCE config flow and
persists both to `entry.data`. Every subsequent token refresh and BFF
request observes the live SPKI and compares it to the stored value.

**Mismatch is warn-only**: a HA persistent notification fires
(`haggle_pin_mismatch_<host>`) and a WARNING is logged, but the request
still completes. This is deliberate — a strict-reject mode would brick
HACS users on legitimate AGL cert rotations. The documented remediation
is the standard HA Reconfigure flow on the integration card, which
re-pins both endpoints on success.

**First-install caveat**: a LAN MITM during the initial PKCE flow could
pin the attacker's certificate. PKCE happens in the user's browser
(system trust + visible lock indicator), so this requires compromising
both the browser and the HA host simultaneously.

### Storage

- The OAuth2 refresh token is persisted in HA's config-entry data
  (`.storage/core.config_entries`). On Home Assistant OS this file is
  encrypted at rest; on Docker / venv / manual deployments it is plain
  JSON. We strongly recommend running the integration on HAOS or
  configuring an equivalent encrypted volume for `.storage/`.
- The short-lived access token (15-minute expiry) is **never** persisted.
- The fallback `unique_id` (when contracts cannot be discovered at
  install time) is `sha256(refresh_token)[:16]`, not a token prefix.

### Supply chain

Posture last reviewed in the 2026-07 dependency review (branch
`claude/haggle-dependency-review-x2lupw`); the decisions below are
deliberate and should not be "tidied" without revisiting that review.

**Shipped runtime surface: zero packages.** `manifest.json` declares
`"requirements": []`. Everything the integration imports at runtime
(`aiohttp`, `voluptuous`, `cryptography`) is vendored and version-pinned
by Home Assistant core. Consequences:

- No pip package reaches a user's machine because of this repo; the
  user-facing attack surface is the integration code plus the two
  TOFU-pinned AGL endpoints.
- Dependency alerts and bumps are **dev-only** and are triaged on that
  basis — a green-CI dev bump is zero-user-risk, and a CVE in the
  lockfile is a developer-workstation/CI concern, not a user one.

**Dev lockfile.** `uv.lock` is hash-pinned (sha256 per artifact). It
resolves ~167 packages, ~90% of which are the Home Assistant ecosystem's
transitive tree (via `homeassistant` +
`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`) — the unavoidable cost of
testing against real HA, and not trimmable from this side. The
heavyweights in it (`boto3`, `numpy`, `pillow`, `sqlalchemy`, `grpcio`,
the Bluetooth stack, `pyjwt`) are never imported by haggle code.

**CI / workflows.**

- All GitHub Actions are pinned to 40-character commit SHAs with
  `# vX.Y` comments (Dependabot keeps them current, grouped weekly).
- Workflow-level `permissions: read-all` on `ci.yml`, `hacs.yml`,
  `hassfest.yml`, `scorecard.yml`. `release.yml` scopes
  `contents: write` + `id-token: write` + `attestations: write` to its
  single job.
- **No third-party actions in privileged workflows**: the GitHub Release
  is created with the first-party `gh` CLI, not a third-party action.
- **No external coverage vendor**: the Codecov upload was removed
  (write-only output, third-party code on every PR).
- `hacs/action` and `home-assistant/actions` are SHA-of-branch pins —
  upstream cuts no tagged releases. Accepted: they are the ecosystem's
  own validation gates, and the SHA still freezes the code.
- `ossf/scorecard-action`'s SHA pin freezes only the action *wrapper*;
  its `action.yml` executes `docker://ghcr.io/ossf/scorecard-action:<tag>`,
  a mutable container tag (Codex review on #168). Accepted: digest-pinning
  the image would bypass the supported wrapper and desync from Dependabot's
  SHA bumps; OSSF cosign-signs the image, and the job's write scopes are
  limited to SARIF upload + Scorecard's own OIDC result publishing.
- The HACS validation step runs without `continue-on-error`.
- Release tags trigger an attested GitHub Release via
  `actions/attest-build-provenance` (Sigstore-rooted; verifiable with
  `gh attestation`).

**Dev-machine hooks.** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` pins every remote hook
to a **frozen commit SHA** (refresh with `pre-commit autoupdate
--freeze`). `ruff` and `mypy` run via `uv run` (`language: system`) so
exactly one toolchain copy exists, versioned by `uv.lock` — the
tag-pinned mirror hooks previously drifted years behind the locked
versions. `gitleaks` stays as pre-commit secret scanning.

**Monitoring.** CodeQL (weekly + per-PR), OpenSSF Scorecard
(`scorecard.yml`, published results + README badge), Dependabot on both
ecosystems with grouped weekly PRs. At the 2026-07 review, direct
dependencies measured 5.4–7.4 on OpenSSF Scorecard (transitives up to
8.5); the weakest triaged link is `pyjwt` (exactly pinned by HA core,
sits in code paths this integration never imports — JWT expiry is
decoded with hand-rolled base64, not PyJWT).

**Own Scorecard posture.** Baseline self-assessment (Scorecard v5.3.0,
2026-07-12) was 7.0/10. After the same-day remediation batch — `protect-main`
ruleset (#171), atheris fuzzing (#173/#177), attested release `v0.4.0-beta.5`
(#174/#178), plus the OpenSSF Best Practices passing badge (#172,
[project 13582](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/13582)) — the
current run scores **7.5/10**, with 10s on Pinned-Dependencies, SAST,
CI-Tests, Dangerous-Workflow, Dependency-Update-Tool, Security-Policy,
License, Binary-Artifacts, Vulnerabilities, **Fuzzing** (0→10,
`PythonAtherisFuzzer integration found`) and **Token-Permissions** (9→10,
top-level `permissions: {}` on `release.yml`). Remaining state, triaged
(verification sweep in #179):

- `Signed-Releases: 8` (was -1) — every release now ships
  `haggle-<ver>.zip` plus its Sigstore bundle (`.zip.sigstore`); verified
  end-to-end with `gh attestation verify haggle-<ver>.zip --repo
  NaanyaBiz/haggle` (SLSA provenance v1, digest match, built from the
  release tag). Scorecard reserves 9–10 for provenance it recognizes by
  the `*.intoto.jsonl` filename convention; the `.zip.sigstore` bundle
  *is* SLSA provenance, so the residual 2 points are a naming artifact.
  **Accepted at 8.**
- `Branch-Protection: 3` (was -1 internal error) — the `protect-main`
  ruleset (#171) is readable by the default workflow token (the
  fine-grained-PAT alternative stays rejected). Scoring above 3 requires
  required human approvers / codeowner review / stale-review dismissal —
  the same team-structure wall as Code-Review. **Accepted at 3** for a
  solo-maintained repo.
- `Maintained: 0` — pure repo-age gate (<90 days); self-resolves ~2026-08.
- `Code-Review: 0`, `Contributors: 0` — measure team structure (a second
  human reviewer; multi-organization contributors). **Accepted at 0** for
  a solo-maintained repo; bot reviews (Codex/Claude) are excluded by
  Scorecard's design and self-review would be theater.
- `Packaging: -1` — means "no PyPI/registry publish workflow"; not
  applicable to a HACS-distributed integration. Inconclusive checks are
  excluded from the aggregate. Accepted.
- `CII-Best-Practices: 5` (was 0) — passing badge earned 2026-07-12 at
  100% of criteria (all 66 answered with evidence). **Accepted at 5**:
  silver requires further process docs and gold requires ≥2 maintainers —
  the same team-structure wall.

Realistic ceiling ≈ 8.5–9 once the Maintained age gate expires (~2026-08):
the residual gap is the team-structure checks above (Code-Review,
Contributors, Branch-Protection's review tiers), which a single-maintainer
project cannot honestly score on.

**Accepted risks (diminishing-returns line).**
`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` is a single-maintainer package
tracked as a range (`<0.14`) — vendoring it would mean self-maintaining
a fork of HA's test harness forever. The HA transitive tree is accepted
as-is. Detection tooling (CodeQL, gitleaks, Scorecard) is kept even
though each adds a component: it is detection surface, not attack
surface.
