# AGENTS.md — Haggle Integration Guide

> **One-liner**: `haggle` is a Home Assistant custom integration that pulls AGL Australia
> smart-meter interval data from AGL's undocumented REST API and feeds it into HA's
> Energy dashboard via `import_statistics()`.

This file is the canonical documentation for both human contributors and AI agents.
`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## Documentation Checklist — Required on Every PR

Every PR that ships code (not pure CI/tooling fixes) MUST include updates to
all of the following before it can be merged. The `/pr` command enforces this.

| Artifact | What to update | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add bullet(s) under `## [Unreleased]` for every user-visible capability added, changed, or fixed | repo root |
| `AGENTS.md` — Repo Map | Add any new files; update descriptions if a file's role changed | this file |
| `AGENTS.md` — AGL API | Correct any API facts that were proven wrong (endpoints, field names, token lifetimes, headers) | this file |
| `AGENTS.md` — What NOT to Do | Add a new prohibition if a footgun was discovered | this file |
| Memory files | Record non-obvious decisions, confirmed API behaviour, or user preferences that should survive context resets | `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` |

**Sprint / phase boundary** (when a branch completes a named sprint or phase):

- Move completed items out of `## [Unreleased]` into a dated `## [x.y.z-dev]` entry.
- Update `## [Unreleased]` → `### Targets for next sprint` with the next block of work.
- Verify the Repo Map matches every file currently in `custom_components/haggle/` and `tests/`.
- Review every bullet in the AGL API section against the current implementation — correct or delete stale facts.

---

## Worktree Workflow

Main worktree (`/Users/dave/projects/haggle/`) is always on `main`. Feature
work happens in sibling worktrees at `/Users/dave/projects/haggle.wt/<branch>/`.
Never commit directly to `main` from a feature worktree — always open a PR.

```bash
# Create a feature worktree
./scripts/wt new feat/agl-login

# Work in the new session:
# → open Claude Code at ../haggle.wt/feat-agl-login/

# Remove when done (refuses if dirty)
./scripts/wt rm feat/agl-login
```

Each worktree shares `.venv` and `.claude/settings.local.json` via symlink.

## AGL API — Key Facts

### Authentication (Auth0 PKCE)

- **Auth host**: `https://secure.agl.com.au`
- **Setup grant**: `authorization_code` + PKCE (`S256`). The config flow
  generates a PKCE verifier+challenge, builds an `/authorize` URL, and shows
  it to the user. The user opens the URL in their **real browser** (handles
  Akamai bot-protection + MFA transparently), then pastes the callback URL back.
  The integration extracts the `code` and POSTs to `/oauth/token`.
  - `redirect_uri`: `https://secure.agl.com.au/ios/au.com.agl.mobile/callback`
  - `scope`: `openid profile email offline_access`
  - `audience`: `https://api.platform.agl.com.au/` (trailing slash required)
- **Ongoing grant**: `refresh_token` (stored in `entry.data`).
- **Token endpoint**: `POST /oauth/token`
- **client_id**: `2mDkNcC8gkDLL7FTT1ZxF5rrQHrLTHL3` (documented 2026-04-30)
- **Required headers**: `Client-Flavor: app.iOS.public.8.38.0-531`
- **Access token**: JWT (RS256), `exp` = **15 min** (`expires_in: 900` — confirmed 2026-05-01). Decode `exp`; refresh 2 min early.
- **CRITICAL — token rotation**: Auth0 **rotates** the refresh token on every
  exchange. The integration MUST persist the new refresh token via
  `_persist_refresh_token` callback after every exchange or it will lock
  itself out on the next restart.

### Data API

- **Base**: `https://api.platform.agl.com.au`
- **Required headers on ALL data endpoints** (documented from AGL mobile app 8.38.0-531, 2026-05-01):
  - `Client-Flavor: app.iOS.public.8.38.0-531`
  - `Client-Device: Apple-iPhone-iPhone14,7-iOS-26.4.2`
  - `Accept-Language: en-AU,en;q=0.9`
  - `Accept-Features: <long feature-flag list>` — see `AGL_ACCEPT_FEATURES` in `const.py`.
    Must include `UsageEnableHistoricalMeterReads`. **Omitting any of these headers causes
    HTTP 500 on Hourly/Daily usage endpoints** (overview and plan are more permissive).
- **`scaling` query parameter**: Hourly and Daily usage URLs require
  `&scaling=36.514404_108.057_40.670903_120.357_0_0_0_0` (screen DPI vector for chart
  rendering). Without it, the BFF returns HTTP 500.
- **Contract discovery**: `GET /mobile/bff/api/v3/overview`
  - Key fields: `accounts[].accountNumber`, `accounts[].contracts[].contractNumber`
  - `contractNumber` ≠ `accountNumber` — use `contractNumber` in all data paths
- **30-min interval data** (despite "Hourly" in the path):
  `GET /mobile/bff/api/v2/usage/smart/Electricity/{contractNumber}/Current/Hourly?period=YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD&scaling=...`
- **kWh source of truth**: `consumption.values.quantity` — NOT `consumption.quantity`
  (which is UI-rounded) and NOT `consumption.values.amount` (same value but semantically cost)
- **`dateTime` field**: slot start, in **UTC**. Convert to local for display.
- **`consumption.type`**: `normal` | `peak` | `offpeak` | `shoulder` | `none`
  (filter out `none` — future-dated or unavailable intervals)

### Polling Cadence

| Data | Interval | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 30-min intervals | 24 h | AGL data is delayed 24-48 h (AEMO feed lag) |
| Daily series | 6 h | Picks up newly available days |
| Plan / overview | 7 days | Rarely changes |
| Token refresh | Just-in-time (< 2 min to `exp`) | tokens expire at 15 min |

**Do not poll for today's hourly data** — it will be empty. Fetch *yesterday*.

### Previous Bill Period

```
GET /mobile/bff/api/v2/usage/smart/Electricity/{contractNumber}/Previous/Hourly?period=YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD&scaling=...
```

Used for backfill of dates **before** the current billing period start (`bill_period.start`).
Confirmed working back to at least 2025-12-24 (single-day period params). Requires the same
`Accept-Features`/`Client-Device`/`scaling` headers as `Current/Hourly`.

### Plan / Rates

```
GET /mobile/bff/api/v2/plan/energy/{contractNumber}
```

Returns `gstInclusiveRates` list with `c/kWh` and `c/day` entries. Supply charge
is a `c/day` entry with `title` containing "Supply charge".

## Energy Dashboard Contract

The HA Energy dashboard requires:
- `device_class = ENERGY`, `state_class = TOTAL_INCREASING`, `native_unit_of_measurement = kWh`
- Historical data MUST be fed via `async_add_external_statistics()` (not live state updates).
  AGL data is always historical — the recorder writes it to the correct UTC hour slot
  regardless of when the API call happened. Skipping this means the Energy dashboard shows
  a spike at poll time, not a smooth historical chart.
- Statistic IDs per contract:
  - `haggle:consumption_<contract_number>` — kWh, `has_sum=True`, **`unit_class="energy"`**
  - `haggle:cost_<contract_number>` — AUD, `has_sum=True`, `unit_class=None`
- **`unit_class="energy"` is required** on the consumption statistic for it to appear in
  the Energy dashboard's "add consumption source" picker. `unit_class=None` silently excludes
  it from the UI filter even though the data is in the DB.
- Resume point: `get_last_statistics(hass, 1, stat_id, True, {"start", "sum"})` — returns
  the last-imported hour so incremental updates don't re-import already-stored rows.
- Each import call is idempotent: `(statistic_id, start)` updates in place.

---

## What NOT to Do

- **No `requests`** — always `aiohttp`. Blocking I/O in the event loop will freeze HA.
- **No blocking I/O in the coordinator** — `_async_update_data` must be fully async.
- **No OTP/portal flow** — auth is PKCE via the user's real browser, not portal scraping.
- **No hardcoded contract numbers** — they come from `/v3/overview` at config time.
- **No polling faster than 24 h for interval data** — AGL won't have newer data.
- **Don't store `access_token` in `entry.data`** — it's transient (15 min).
  Persist only `refresh_token` to `entry.data`; keep `access_token` in memory only.
- **Don't use `async_add_executor_job`** for AGL API calls — they're already async.
- **Don't pass `access_token` to `AglAuth`** — `AglAuth.__init__` expects a `refresh_token`.
  Passing an `access_token` silently fails: `async_force_refresh` posts it as a refresh_token,
  Auth0 rejects it, and the contract number is never set → HTTP 404 on every data call.
  For one-shot calls with a bare bearer token (e.g. config flow), use a direct `aiohttp` GET.
- **Don't omit `Accept-Features` / `Client-Device` / `scaling`** — omitting any of these
  from Hourly or Daily usage requests returns HTTP 500 with no useful error body.
- **Don't set `unit_class=None` on the consumption statistic** — HA's Energy dashboard
  consumption picker filters by `unit_class="energy"`. `None` silently hides the statistic.
- **No committing directly to `main`** — the `guard-main-branch` hook blocks it.
  Use a feature branch + PR.

## Contributing — Adding a New Endpoint

To add support for a new AGL API endpoint:

1. **Identify the endpoint contract** from your own AGL account. Any standard
   HTTP-debugging tool of your choice is fine — you only need the resulting URL
   path, required headers, and JSON response shape.
2. **Anonymise before committing**: redact `accountNumber`, `contractNumber`,
   address, product code, and any meter-read timeseries that fingerprint a real
   residence. Use the placeholders in `tests/fixtures/overview_response.json`
   as the canonical set (`1234567890` / `9999999999` / `1 Sample Street SUBURB QLD 4000`).
3. Add an anonymised fixture under `tests/fixtures/<name>_response.json`.
4. Add a parser in `agl/parser.py` and a corresponding `AglClient` method in
   `agl/client.py`.
5. Add tests against the fixture. Do not commit any captures with real customer
   values.

## Commit Conventions

Conventional Commits format is enforced by `commitlint` pre-commit hook:

```
feat: add daily consumption sensor
fix: handle missing consumption.values.quantity
chore(release): v0.2.0
ci: add hacs workflow
```

Every commit MUST include the `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer. The
`require-claude-coauthor` pre-commit hook enforces this. Example:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement token rotation persistence

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

## Provenance

This codebase was generated by AI (Claude, Anthropic) and reviewed by the human
maintainer (@naanyabiz). All commits carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailers.
The integration is built against the API responses returned to a legitimate AGL
customer using AGL's own mobile client endpoints. No proprietary AGL code is
included. Anonymised response shapes are mirrored under `tests/fixtures/`; the
full API contract is documented in the "AGL API — Key Facts" section above.
